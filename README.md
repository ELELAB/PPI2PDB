This repository includes the MAVISp tools for the INTERACTOME module.
They provide for Mentha or for STRING the following data:
- known interactors for a target protein ranked by scores
- annotations on available experimental PDB structures for the complexes
- annotations on available pre-calculated models with AFmultimer and experimentally validated, along with their pDOCKQ2 score
- input files for AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3
